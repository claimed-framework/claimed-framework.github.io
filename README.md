# CLAIMED Project Documentation

Welcome to **CLAIMED**, a framework designed to transform your code into reusable, composable components that can run across diverse execution environments with built-in scaling and fault tolerance.

---

## Central Project Objective

- **C3 Compiler**: Develop a unified system that transforms arbitrary code into standardized, reusable AI and data components.  
- **Seamless Deployment**: Enable components to run across heterogeneous environments including Kubernetes, Docker, Slurm, LSF, and local or virtual setups.  
- **Infrastructure Abstraction**: Automate packaging, dependency resolution, and environment isolation to ensure consistent execution.  
- **Parallelization**: Facilitate grid-computing style workload distribution across available compute resources with minimal user intervention.  
- **Composability**: Promote reuse of data engineering, data science, and AI pipelines through a flexible but opinionated component ecosystem.

## Project Roadmap

### Progress to Date

- Established core architecture for reusable data engineering, data science, and AI components.  
- Implemented initial component registry and composition logic for modular and reproducible pipelines.  
- Integrated foundational runtime support for Docker- and Kubernetes-based execution.  
- Developed early prototypes of the C3 Compiler, converting Python and Bash workflows into self-contained components.  
- Set up continuous integration pipelines.  
- Shifted primary focus to the C3 Compiler for seamless composition, scaling, and multi-platform execution (EU funded).  
- Developed containerless execution framework to remove reliance on Docker while maintaining reproducibility (EU funded).  

### Future Developments

- **Dependency Minimization**: Streamline runtime to remove heavy infrastructure dependencies, improving portability and security.  
- **Scalable Execution Backends**: Expand native support for Kubernetes, Docker, Slurm, LSF, and local/virtual environments.  
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Simplify component creation and sharing via CLI and SDK improvements.  
- **Automated Testing**: Integrate full test coverage into CI/CD pipelines with a target of ≥80%.  

### Upcoming Releases

- **v0.8 (Q4 2025)**:  
  - Core C3 Compiler with initial composition and multi-platform execution.  
  - Basic containerless execution prototype.  
  - CLI enhancements and improved developer onboarding.  

- **v0.9 (Q1 2026)**:  
  - Full dependency minimization pass.  
  - Expanded publishing targets (MLX, PyPI, Conda).  
  - Integrated test harness with coverage reporting.  

- **v1.0 (Mid 2026)**:  
  - Stable C3 Compiler release.  
  - Full-scale containerless execution support.  
  - Robust component ecosystem ready for production-scale deployment.  
  - Achieve ≥80% test coverage and validated reproducibility across environments.
